# Code Challenge 6

# Add three new methods to the Linked List class

## Challenge

-   append

    -   arguments: new value
    -   adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

-   insert before

    -   arguments: value, new value
        adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

-   insert after
    -   arguments: value, new value
        adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Approach & Efficiency

-   Time: O(N)
-   Space: O(N)

## Solution

[LinkedList](../assets/ll2.png)

# Code Challenge 7

# k-th value from the end of a linked list

## Challenge

-   Write the following method for the Linked List class:
    -   kth from end
    -   argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
    -   Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

-   Time: O(N)
-   Space: O(N)

## Solution

[LinkedList - k-th value](../assets/CodeChallenge7.jpg)

# Code Challenge 8

# Zip two linked lists.

## Challenge

-   a function called zip lists
    -   Arguments: 2 linked lists
    -   Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below
    -   Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate
    -   between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.
    -   Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
    -   You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List
    -   class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency

-   Time: O(N)
-   Space: O(N)

## Solution

[LinkedList - zip lists](./linked_list/assets/cc8.png)
