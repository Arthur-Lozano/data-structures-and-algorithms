# Code Challenges

# Add three new methods to the Linked List class

## Challenge

-   append

    -   arguments: new value
    -   adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

-   insert before

    -   arguments: value, new value
        adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

-   insert after
    -   arguments: value, new value
        adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
