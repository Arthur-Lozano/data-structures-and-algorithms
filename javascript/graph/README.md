# Graphs

> Write tests to prove the following functionality:
> Node can be successfully added to the graph
> An edge can be successfully added to the graph
> A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
> All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
> Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
> The proper size is returned, representing the number of nodes in the graph
> A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
> An empty graph properly returns null
