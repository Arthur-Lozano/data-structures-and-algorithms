## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- Identify the start and end of the array (0 and length -1)
- Swap the arr[start] with arr[end]
- Move Start forward by 1
- Move End backwards by 1
- Repeat while start <= end

# Shift Array

### 

- Insert a new value into the middle of an array without using any built in methods


## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
A math method with a loop and a push to an array that is returned

# Array - Binary - Search

### 

- Utilize binary search 


## Challenge

- Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Go through the array comparing the key if the key is greater than certain number we get rid of those numbers and repeat from the opposite end until we find our number or if the number is not there we return -1.
